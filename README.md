# Welcome To Starbucks!

This app is designed for mobile ordering  Starbucks drinks!

## Usage

There are three current routes, which are navigated through with a nav bar: 

#home("/")
The home component houses the most recent orders put into the order app. Whenever a new order is submitted, it shows up in the most recent orders on the home page. It also has a fun clock component showing the current time! 

#coffee
The coffee component houses a collection of cards showing coffee suggestions by Starbucks, showing possible drinks to order, as well as all of the orders placed by customers, similar to order tickets that pop out for baristas to make.

#coffee/new
The coffee/new component houses the order form, where customers can navigate to place their order, adding the name, description, any inclusions or things to leave out, sizing, and even an image link so baristas can see exactly what the customer wants!

#extra
There is also a fun dark/light mode at the top that customers can use to shift between whichever their preference is.
