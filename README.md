# Welcome to Starbucks!

This project is designed to simulate a mobile order app for starbucks coffee!

## What can one do? 

There are three current routes: 

### `Home`

The home component contains most recent orders to show what you've just ordered or ordered recently! It updates every time an order is added to the Coffee component!

### `coffee`

The coffee component contains all the coffee orders starbucks has to order! Check out any of these options to get ideas on what you might want to try! Once you know, make your way to the Mobile Order page!

### `coffee/new`

The coffee/new component is where you can place your order! you can put in a name, a description with what size you want, what you want to add or leave out, what type of drink it may be, blended, tea, brewed, espresso etc, and an image link to give our baristas an idea of what you are looking for!
